# Smart Blind Stick:

This project serves to help the blind people with the ability to avoid obstacles instead of completely relying on their senses. It makes use of an Ultra-sonic sensor to detect obstacles in the path. Everytime an obstacle is encountered, a signal is sent and the buzzer buzzes notifying the blind man about an obstable.
